= Dynested

This will be a Rails extension to support dynamic collections in
views that are friendly with accepts_nested_attributes_for in
models.

Initially, this is intended to be compatible with Rails 3.0.x
and newer, using jQuery.  Support for Rails 2.x and/or Prototype
might or might not be added later.
