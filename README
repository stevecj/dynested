Dynested
========

This will be a Rails extension to support dynamic collections in
views that are freindly with accepts_nested_attributes_for in
models.

Initially, this is intended to be compatible with Rails 3.0.x
and newer, using jQuery.  Support for Rails 2.x and Prototype
might or might not be added later.
